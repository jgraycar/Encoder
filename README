Compile and create jar/app using "ant" command

Commands:
-    "ant jar" or just "ant" will create jar file in "dist/lib/Encoder-${DSTAMP}"
-    "ant compile" will create build directory and store *.classes there.
-    "ant init" will simply create empty build directory.
-    "ant clean" will delete build and dist directories.
-    "ant bundle-app" will create the EncoderGUI.app file. You will need to
     first move the most recent Encoder-${DSTAMP}.jar file to EncoderGUI.jar for
     it to work.
