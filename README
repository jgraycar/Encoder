Encoder is an encryption/decryption software package developed by Joel Graycar in 2014.
It utilizes modular arithmetic to transform the bytes of a file by a random amount.

Compile and create jar/app/dmg by using either Apache Ant or Gradle.

Ant Commands:
-    "ant jar" or just "ant" will create jar file in "dist/lib/Encoder-${DSTAMP}.jar" and
     "dist/lib/Encoder.jar"
-    "ant compile" will create build directory and store *.classes there.
-    "ant init" will simply create empty build directory.
-    "ant clean" will delete build and dist directories.
-    "ant bundle-app" will create the Encoder.app file.
-    "ant dmg" will create the ENCODER disk image file.

To build using Gradle, simply substitute "gradle" for "ant" and use any of the same commands.
